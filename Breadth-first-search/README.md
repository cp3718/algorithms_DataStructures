**Bread-first search algorithm**

**Question:** 
This question has three parts 1, 2 and 3.

We will use a gene network graph from [Biogrid](https://thebiogrid.org/) for the
species Arabidopsis thaliana. The gene interaction network is provided called large.graph. The Gene
names in this species start with AT, followed by chromosome number, followed by G for gene, finally and unique identifier. For example, we will use AT5G49450 as our source.

1. Implement a breadth-first search algorithm using any programming language of your
choice. (Used Python)

2. Determine the shortest path using results from Breadth-first search.

Once we have the results of BFS, use it to find the shortest path. 

3. 'S' will be AT5G49450 and your 'V' will be AT5G65210.

(S -> Source; V -> Vertex/Destination)
